# Data Engineering Scripts Playground

This repository contains small Python scripts related to **data engineering** and **ETL**.  
They are not big enough to become full projects, but I want to keep them stored because they are **useful** and may serve as **reference** in the future.

Most of them are:
- Small experiments and tests.
- Useful code snippets for parsing, cleaning, or transforming data.
- Quick automations and ETL helpers.

These scripts are mainly for **learning purposes** and to keep track of ideas, but some can be directly reused in real workflows.
